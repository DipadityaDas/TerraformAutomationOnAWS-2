# Infrastructure as a Code using Terraform on AWS Cloud(Task-2)

*If I say you that the automation of the whole infrastructure can be done just writing one code. It sounds exciting, isn’t it? Well yes, we can.*

> ***"Necessity is the mother of Invention."***

*So, what’s the necessity I am talking about? Well, let’s say you are working on a cloud computing platform like AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure and wanted to build an infrastructure. How much time does it take to build the entire plan? How much time does someone need to evolve the present infrastructure? Can anyone build the plan from nothing to everything in one go? Yes, you can by using Terraform with the cloud computing service(IaaS).*

## What is Terraform?

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is the *infrastructure as a code* offering from [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/). It is a tool for building, changing and managing infrastructure in a safe, repeatable way. Operators and Infrastructure teams can use Terraform to manage environments with a configuration language called the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for human-readable, automated deployments.

> *Terraform works with over **160** different providers for a broad set of common infrastructure. Provider SDK makes it simple to create new and custom providers. Providers leverage infrastructure-specific APIs to preserve unique capabilities for each provider.*
